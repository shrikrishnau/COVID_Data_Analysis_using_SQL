## Problem statement
The World Covid has to be sourced from web, cleaned and analysed using SQL. Produce your insights from the data after analysis.


## About the data set
* The dataset was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
* This dataset contains the data of population dead due to COVID and vaccinated population of various countries.


## Overall Analysis View
The aim of this project is to find the projected growth of COVID cases.

## SQL Skills Used
* Joins
* CTE's
* Temp Tables
* Windows Functions
* Aggregate Functions
* Creating Views
* Converting Data Types

## Things learnt from this Project 
* Learnt to CTE's and Temp Tables.
* Came across a use case for converting data type and implemented it. 

## Some Important insights from the Analysis

* As of 18th October 2022 there were 4,46,34,376 people totally affected by COVID in India.
* About 5,28,923 people totally died due to COVID in India bringing the death percentage to 1.18%.
* About 3.7% of the Indian population got infected by COVID.
* Cyprus topped the list of country with the highest infection rate compared to population in the world.
* United States of America has the highest death count per population amounting to 10,65,841 deaths.
* This indicate the US heathcare system wasn't adequate enough to handle the COVID crisis and added to this many people refused to follow the COVID restriction protocol which further amplified the spread of the disease.
* In terms of continent, North America has the highest death count per population and Oceania the lowest.
* The total COVID cases around the world totalled to 62,40,72,979 and the deaths totalled to 65,32,258 and the death percentage is 1.04%.
* The COVID spread has slowed drastically with very few new cases popping up owing to accelerated vaccination in various countries.
